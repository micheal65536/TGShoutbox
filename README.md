# Therian Guide Shoutbox

Access the shoutbox on the Therian Guide forums

## Description

Allows you to read and post shouts in the Therian Guide forums shoutbox. Includes support for actions and private shouts.

## Requirements

Requires Android Jelly Bean or later.

## Usage

Type your shout in the entry field on the bar at the bottom of the screen. Tap the send button to the right of the entry field to send the shout.

You can post an "action" shout by tapping the "action" button next to the entry field. Tapping the button again will revert to a standard shout.

You can send a private shout by tapping the leftmost button on the bar and entering the name of the recipient for the shout.

### Tips

Tapping on a shout will let you quickly choose the shout's sender as the recipient for a private shout (if you tap on one of your own private shouts, the shout's recipient will be chosen instead).

Long-pressing on a shout will display the sender's theriotype.

## Known issues

* Emoticons aren't scaled for different screen DPIs. On some devices they may be very small.
* If there is no network connection when the app is opened, it will ask you to log in again. Just cancel the log in page (tap the back or home button) and try again when there is a network connection.
* There is no warning if the app is unable to refresh the shoutbox due to lack of a network connection.
